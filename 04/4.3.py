'''
Python includes two operations for sorting. The method sort() in the
built. -in list data type rearranges the items in the underlying list into
ascending order, much like merge.sort(). In contrast, the built-in
function sorted() leaves the underlying list alone; instead, it returns a
new list containing the items in ascending order.
